After switching to another task, Polycarp cannot return to the previous task.</p><p>Polycarp can only solve one task during the day. Every day he wrote down what task he solved. Now the teacher wants to know if Polycarp followed his advice.</p><p>For example, if Polycarp solved tasks in the following order: &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">DDBBCCCBBEZ</span>&quot;, then the teacher will see that on the third day Polycarp began to solve the task &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>&apos;, then on the fifth day he got distracted and began to solve the task &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>&apos;, on the eighth day Polycarp returned to the task &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>&apos;.
