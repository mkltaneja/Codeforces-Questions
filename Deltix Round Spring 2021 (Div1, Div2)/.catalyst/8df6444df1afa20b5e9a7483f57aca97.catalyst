The device functions in the following way:</p><p>Initially, all lights on William&apos;s device are turned off. At the beginning of a new iteration the device randomly, with a uniform distribution, picks a light that is turned off and turns it on, telling William which cryptocurrency he should invest in. After this iteration if any $$$k$$$ consecutive lights contain more than one turned on light, then the device finishes working.</p><p>William doesn&apos;t like uncertainty, so he wants you to calculate the expected value of the number of lights that are turned on in the device after it finishes working.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10$$$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The only line for each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^5$$$), which are the total number of lights and the length of subsegment of lights that are being checked, respectively.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>For each test case print the answer, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. </p><p>Formally, let $$$M = 10^9+7$$$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \\not \\equiv 0 \\pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \\cdot q^{-1} \\bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \\le x &lt; M$$$ and $$$x \\cdot q \\equiv p \\pmod{M}$$$.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Explanation of the first sample test case:</span></p><p>Let&apos;s write out all possible sequences of light toggles, which will make the device complete its operation:</p><ol> <li> $$$(1, 2)$$$ &#xA0;&#x2014; $$$2$$$ lights are turned on </li><li> $$$(1, 3, 2)$$$ &#xA0;&#x2014; $$$3$$$ lights are turned on </li><li> $$$(2, 1)$$$ &#xA0;&#x2014; $$$2$$$ lights are turned on </li><li> $$$(2, 3)$$$ &#xA0;&#x2014; $$$2$$$ lights are turned on </li><li> $$$(3, 2)$$$ &#xA0;&#x2014; $$$2$$$ lights are turned on </li><li> $$$(3, 1, 2)$$$ &#xA0;&#x2014; $$$3$$$ lights are turned on </li></ol><p>Then the final expected value will be equal to $$$\\frac{2}{6}$$$ + $$$\\frac{3}{6}$$$ + $$$\\frac{2}{6}$$$ + $$$\\frac{2}{6}$$$ + $$$\\frac{2}{6}$$$ + $$$\\frac{3}{6}$$$ = $$$\\frac{14}{6}$$$ = $$$\\frac{7}{3}$$$. </p><p>Then the required output will be $$$333333338$$$, since $$$333333338 \\cdot 3 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10^9+7}$$$.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1622385687163,"input":"3\n3 2\n15 2\n40 15\n","output":"333333338\n141946947\n329622137\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1523/submit","language":"c++","isPartOfContest":true}
